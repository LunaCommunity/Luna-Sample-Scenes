Localisation

We recommend that you read through our documentation covering Localisation.

Documentation:
https://docs.lunalabs.io/docs/playable/playable-ads/playable-localisation

Inside this sample project we cover the two methods of localisation outlined in the documentation, however, with slight modification can be used to support both with either font upload with playground, or from inside Unity.

Specific font for different languages, can be found here: https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/tree/release/OTF
(fonts for Japanese, Chinese (Traditional and simplified), and Korean characters)
